# spaceship-game

## Introduction

This is a simple spaceship game that players can use keyboard to control a spaceship to avoid obstacles fallen from the top of the screen. The game is written with Python and Processing. The starter folder in repository contains the separate components of this game, including spaceship, obstacles, and debris. 


## Game Rules

Once the game starts, the player can press the keyboard to control the spaceship with the keys of up, left, down, and right. The goal of the player is to avoid the obstacle and survive as longer as possible. On the lower corner of the screen we can see the current score of the player, which is calculated by the number of obstacle that the player has successfully avoided. We also can see the current difficulty level of the game. We have easy, medium, and hard. By pressing the SHIFT key we can switch to the next level. 

In the easy mode, the obstacles are more scattered. As we change it to medium, the obstacles become more dense, and it is harder to avoid them. When we have the hard mode, the obstacles become really dense, but in the meantime, your score will increase faster, as you will surpass more obstacles at the same amount of time.
